**Software Developer | Backend Engineer****

I’m a final-year engineering student who enjoys building backend systems that actually work in real-world scenarios. Most of my work is around Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, where I focus on writing clean backend logic, designing REST APIs, and structuring applications in a clear and maintainable way. I do have experience with frontend technologies, but my real interest lies in backend development and system design.

I’ve also worked on projects where machine learning is used as part of the system, not as a standalone experiment. In these projects, ML models are integrated into backend services through APIs to support features like prediction and intelligent decision-making. This helped me understand how data-driven logic fits into normal software workflows.

I like learning by building things, fixing issues, and improving existing code. I’m especially interested in understanding how backend systems scale, how data flows through applications, and how to write code that is easy to maintain and extend.

**Technologies & Tools**

**Languages**: Java, C++, Python
**Backend**: Spring Boot, REST APIs
**Database**: MySQL
**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, React
**Tools**: Git, Postman, VS Code
